# LoopBot
A simple demo bot that will buy NFTs from LoopExchange.

You will need to create an appsettings.json file in the directory with the setting "Copy to Output Directory" set to "Copy Always" like below. DO NOT SHARE ANY OF YOUR KEYS WITH ANYONE!
```json
{

  "Settings": {
    "LoopringApiKey": "kdlblahaha", //Your loopring api key
    "LoopringPrivateKey": "0xbalahha", //Your Loopring private key
    "LoopringAddress": "0xblahaha", //Your loopring address
    "LoopringAccountId": 40940, //Your loopring account id
    "L1PrivateKey": "assdsxa", //Your L1 Private Key
    "Exchange": "0x0BABA1Ad5bE3a5C0a66E7ac838a129Bf948f1eA4" //Loopring Exchange address
